# Pandas Tutorial

In pandas we have two datastructure:

* Series, which can be thought as an array or as pandas 1D data structure)
* DataFrame, which can be thought as a matrix or as pandas 2D data structure)

A DataFrame can be also viewed as an array of Series,
dataframes and series are flexible, and can contain labels for fields,
row indexes and many other interesting features which would be complicated
to have on plain arrays/matrices.
